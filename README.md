# Static Website

My goofy static website that I created while taking Web Design.

Challenge: Create a static website using HTML and CSS. Incorporate knowledge around using different elements and attributes as well as CSS style rules.

Context: I had originally taken Web Design during my undergrad at MSU Bozeman in 2011 with little interest in computer science at the time. Upon enrolling at Helena College, these credits transferred over so I did not need to take it again. However, I remembered very little and needed a refresher so I used the class materials provided by my instructor and classmates to take the class on my own over the summer in 2023.

Action: This website I created was not intended in any way to be a serious design; I simply wanted to showcase my understanding of basic Web Design principles such as using anchor tags for navigation, utilizing a grid layout, using id's and classes as well as using dynamic pseudo-classes (:hover), and several other concepts. I expanded on a few of the examples from the tutorials in the book HTML5 and CSS3, 7th Edition Comprehensive by Patrick Carey. 

Result: Although there are only two pages contained in the website, I was able to employ several concepts and techniques that are assumed to be understood for basic static website design. Again, this website simply showcases my understanding of web design concepts. The content was added with humor and is not to be taken seriously (e.g. the contact info is fictional); although, the tidbits of info about me are somewhat accurate.

Reflection: I enjoyed learning the material while taking the Web Design course on my own. I remembered virtually nothing from taking it as an undergrad in 2011 and a lot has evolved since then anyway, so this was a good experience to get caught up. Since so many of the concepts are used in other web design languages, it was a useful endeavor to re-educate myself.
